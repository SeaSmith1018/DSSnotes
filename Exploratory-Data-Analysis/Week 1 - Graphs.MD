#####Principles of Analytic Graphics

Edward Tufte (2006) Beautiful Evidence  
1. Show comparisons  
  i. Evidence of one hypothesis is relative to another competing hypothesis.  
  ii. Always ask "Compared to "What?"  
2. Show causality, mechanism, explanation, systemic structure  
  i. What is your causal framework for thinking about a question?  
3. Show multivariate data (show as much data as possible on a chart)  
  i. Multivariate = more than 2 variables  
  ii. The real world is multivariate  
  iii. Need to "escape flatland"  
4. Integration of evidence  
  i. Completely integrate words, numbers, images, diagrams  
 ii. Data graphics should make use of many modes of data presentation  
 iii. Don't let the tool drive the analysis  
5. Describe and document the evidence with appropriate labels, scales, scources, etc  
 i. A data graphic should tell a complete story that is credible  
6. Content is king  
 i. Analytical presentations ultimately stand or fall depending on the quality, relevance, and integrity of their content
